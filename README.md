# hack-a-thing-1-react-native

Description of what I did:
I built a mini Youtube search app that allows you to browse videos on Youtube
with a quick search. I followed instructions from an extra credit assignment from CS52.

Created by:
Steven Kim (worked alone)

What I learned:
I learned how to build mobile apps using all the tools I've learned from CS52. I now know
how implement code, run it, and test it on both a simulator and a phone.

What didn't work:
I struggled connecting my iPhone to my computer. I didn't realize they both needed to be
on the same network. I also had some trouble with installation (using brew over npm), as there were
lots of react-native specific installations.
